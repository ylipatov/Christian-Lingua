                   <strong>We are a translation ministry and not a business.</strong>
                    Our goal is to partner with you to expand God's Kingdom.
               </span>

                <span>
                    Our commitment towards our partners and customers is well known amongst those who have decided to work
                    with us.
                </span>

                <span>
                    Is your project a one-page devotional? Is it about translating a 69-volume commentary series with over
                44,000 pages into 25 languages? Or perhaps it’s about translating and subtitling 15,000 minutes of
                Christian videos into 9 languages. We have undertaken all these projects successfully and can surely
                complete yours. <strong>Trust cannot be bought with money so we work very hard to earn your
                trust.</strong>
                Perhaps 120 references from our clients can be a good start.
                </span>

                <span>
                    Christian Lingua is consistently chosen over many Christian/non-Christian translation agencies due to
                its ability to undertake complex projects, provide superior accuracy, deliver on time, and quote at
                highly affordable prices.
